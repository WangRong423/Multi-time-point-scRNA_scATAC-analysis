## Overview

Trained immunity, particularly in monocytes, is recognized as a nonspecific, broad-acting defense mechanism against infection. However, the temporal dynamics of trained immunity in response to prime and booster vaccinations remain poorly characterized. In this study, we employed single-nucleus multi-omics (snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) sampled from individuals who received inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
